    # first write a program that will compare vegas 2H to actual 2H
    # second, use business logic from ^^ to compare vegas 2H to my prediction 2H
        # NOTE: use the actual 2H spread from ESPN

# PROGRAM 1: CompareVegasToActual.py
    for vegas_file in ./half_time_spreads:
        generate all combination of team names
            NOTE: the trailing date shall be spliced off
        for espn_link in dates:
            if game found:
                spread at half = team_1 - team_2
                final spread =
                difference =
                break espn_link loop
        multiply difference by -1 (to match vegas style)
        compare to vegas value

# PROGRAM 2: CompareVegasToMine.py
